In JavaScript, it is not like what it is in Java. 
You don't need to show which array contains what, just initialize it with const.

* Ordered.
* Zero Indeced
* Dynamic Size
* Heterogenous.

Access it by saying [i], index.

# document.getElementById()
<div id="stepTitle">1. Choose base.</div>
Returns this element.
