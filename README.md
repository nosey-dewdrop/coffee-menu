# coffee-menu
i am working as a barista in a third wave coffee shop. (important to say because third wave coffee shops only really care about the taste. we are not fast-food-shops [they are called second wave])

i want people to know about coffee. <br> *what is americano vs filter coffee?* <br> *cappucino vs latte vs flat white vs cortado ????*
